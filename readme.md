Title : Employee Management System

While the entire world came to a halt, the software industry kept on charging forward. Different 
industries are undergoing revolutionary digitization as the world gets normalized with living in 
virtual spaces. The demand for managing the employees working from the confines of their homes 
will grow exponentially as the entire work landscape has changed dramatically. This system intends 
to fill into the vacuum that has been created by this unforeseen growth. Serving as an intermediatory 
between the workers and the company, it would enable efficient free-flow of information.
